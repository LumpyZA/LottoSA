# LottoSA
Lottery SA predictions based on machine learning

The goal here is the following:

1.  Collect lottery stats from SA lotto website
2.  Compile the dataset from this data. 
3.  Create a WSGI interface to view data
4.  Create ML experiments from the dataset
5.  Get the controller to initiate the different ML experiments to collate the predictions
6.  Controller to collate the predictions into a lotto format
7.  Once completed, track the progress of the predictions
8.  Generate a backtesting module
9.  Initiate a ML testpack on other lotteries
10. Apply the ML learnings into SA lottery
11. Create a site to collect the details, apply to server
12. Lets the service run by itself
13. Build AI to adjust the values to find the best accuracy
14. Improve again
15. Create a web app from the site.

Some notes:

WSGI interface from:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnDANxsaYo
Written in python and will use ML technologies
Eventually use Django as WSGI server
Deploy using docker on linux server
Create version control
